The Pullbase web UI offers a fast way to review environments, manage users, and issue agent tokens. Use it alongside the CLI and API for visibility and manual operations.

## Sign-in

- Visit your Pullbase URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` for development or `https://pullbase.example.com` for production).
- Enter the admin or user credentials created during bootstrapping.
- The session cookie stores a JWT; sign out via the avatar menu when finished.

## Dashboard

The landing page summarizes key metrics:

- Environment count and drift status
- Recent activity feed (status reports, token creation, rollbacks)
- Quick links to environments and servers

## Environments view

Navigate to **Environments** to manage Git metadata.

- Search or filter environments by name
- Inspect repository URL, branch, deploy path, and target commit hash
- Toggle auto-reconcile, edit metadata, or delete the environment
- Initiate rollbacks and view rollback history

## Servers View

Navigate to **Servers** to see all Pullbase managed servers.

- Search or filter servers by name
- Inspect environment association and status
- View last applied commit and drift status

## Server detail view

From an environment page, choose a server to see its status timeline.

- View last applied commit, drift flag, and timestamps
- Monitor reconciliation history and error messages
- Issue or revoke agent tokens directly from the server page

## Token management

- Use **Add Token** to generate a new agent token
- Tokens include description and optional expiration date
- Copy the token immediately; Pullbase never shows the secret again (tokens are hashed at rest)

<Warning>
Rotate tokens by creating a new one, updating the agent, and then revoking the old token. Avoid deleting active tokens before the agent refreshes.
</Warning>

## User management

Accessible via **Settings → Users** (admins only).

- Create, list, or delete users
- Set roles (`admin`, `user`, `viewer`)
- Deletion requires typing the username to confirm; Pullbase blocks deletion of the last active admin or your own account
